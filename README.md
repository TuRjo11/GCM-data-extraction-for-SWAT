These scripts are specially for the precipitation and temperature extraction from the GCM dataset provided by Vimal Mishra, Udit Bhatia, & Amar Deep Tiwari. (2020). Bias corrected climate projections from CMIP6 models for Indian sub-continental river basins [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3874046 (website link: https://zenodo.org/records/3874046)

Steps:
1) Import the txt GCM data into a blank excel
2) Run the script 'Filtering large GCM dataset'
3) Run the remaining scripts for extracting precipitation and temperature into subbasin wise csv files
4) Run the script'Station wise pcp and tmp for SWAT WGEN' in order to make the pcp and tmp file for creating WGEN database.

Some notes: 
**The precipitation and temperature extraction is based on 30 years for analysis
